                        <p class="text-secondary"><b>Brief :</b> Built for a problem statement by the Indian Space Reasearch Organization, DistPano was a distributed computing system for performing image stitching on high resolution geo images using public compute nodes.
                            Images clicked using drones, provided by <b>ISRO</b> were stitched together using distributed public compute nodes, effectively bringing down processing time exponentially.<br><br>• Developed an algorithm to solve the problem of splitting and stitching images to create panorama. • These developed algorithms have minimized and optimized
                            working solutions for splitting and stitching images.<br>• Used several tools and methodology to create this application.<br><br><br><b>Tech Stack :</b> PHP, C++,REST API Java, JavaScript, Python, OpenCV, MySQL.</p>
